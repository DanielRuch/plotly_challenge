# Plotly Challenge
# 
## Tools Used:
### D3.js
### Plotly.js
### JSON data structure
### Javascript
### HTML/CSS
# 
## Objectives: 
### Import data from JSON files via D3.js
### Visualize biodiversity data - 4 different views, combined in an interactive dashboard
# 
## Challenges:
#### The biodiversity dataset was large and spread across multiple JSON files, so cleaning the independent datasets and joining them together within the scope of Javascript was one of the primary challenges of this project. Manipulating the data into a format that each of the unique visualizations could consume was another challenge point, as well as filtering the data that was sent to each of the graphics, based on a dropdown list that was also dynamically populated.
# 
## Opportunities for Improvement:
#### The dashboard provides a filterable, pivotable view of the data as it relates to different metrics, however there are opportunities to do even more with the data. Effectively, some of the story is not being told. There were also a number of other datasets that could potentially be pulled in to even further enhance the information presented.
